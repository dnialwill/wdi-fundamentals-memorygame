Memory Game: Unit Homework for WDI Fundamentals

This is my fork of the final project for the WDI Fundamentals section of the March 2017 WDIr course. It currently meets the deliverable standards for the project but will likely be undergoing some significant revision during the coming weeks to improve and expand upon its current functionality and design. This fork utilizes resources from donpark's scalable-css-playing-cards (http://donpark.github.io/scalable-css-playing-cards/); though only the face card and card back images have been included in this repo, it is likely that the scalable-css-playing-cards software will be implemented in the future, thus the original license is appended in full to "LICENSE.md".
